		<h2>A story</h2>
		<p>Artemis is the daughter of Zeus and Leto, who is the twin sister of Apollo. Artemis is the Goddess of the moon, the hunt and the virginity. Even Artemis is the Goddess of the virginity, but she was falling in love with Orion, who was the son of Poseidon. However, Apollo wanted to keep Artemis’ virginity, he lied Artemis kill Orion by herself. In the mythology, it says, “One day, while Orion is walking out in the sea, Apollo invites Artemis to the beach. He brags about his marksmanship, and then dares her to prove her hunting ability by hitting a black speck far out at sea, which he knows is Orion.” After that, Artemis is angry on Apollo and never forgives him. On another side, Apollo wants Artemis to forgive him, but Artemis always left earlier than he arrives. That’s why the sun never meets with the moon. By the way, Artemis is the Goddess of the moon because Hera always tortures Artemis and Apollo, for compensation, Zeus gives the sun to Apollo and the moon to Artemis.</p>
